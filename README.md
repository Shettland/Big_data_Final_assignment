# Big_data_Final_assignment
Big data final assignment MSC's computational biology.

## Objective.

The objective of this assignment is to create a machine or deep learning algorithm for the Kaggle dataset [Chest X-ray pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) using pyspark's high-level interface.

The approach that was took by the student's group can be found with all the methods and documentation in the next [Jupyter-notebook](Big_data_Final_assignment.ipynb)
